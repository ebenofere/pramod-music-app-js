          K-pop stands for Korean pop, pop being short for pop music. The name
          for the genre is first recorded in English around 1990–95. Strongly
          influenced by Western popular music, K-pop took off in 1992 with Seo
          Taiji and Boys, who incorporated rap, rock, and dance elements into
          Korean popular music.

          Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call
          and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in
          European harmony and African rhythmic rituals. Late 19th century, New

          Bollywood music is derived from song-and-dance routines in Hindi
          films. Due to their enduring popular appeal and cultural value,
          Bollywood songs and dances are a characteristic motif of Hindi cinema

          The Oxford Dictionary defines 'classical music' as “music written in a
          Western musical tradition, usually using an established form (for
          example a symphony). Classical music is generally considered to be
          serious and to have a lasting value.”

          Gangsta rap is a subgenre of late 90s and early 2000s boom-bap. To me,
          the sub-genre is particularly defined by its lyrical content that
          graphically describes the grittier side of life on the streets as a
          gang member. Thecombination of the more formal sound and heavy boom-bap drums created
          a contrast that somehow felt suitable for the intense lyrical
          descriptions of violence and life on the streets.
